# An analysis of divorces and marriages in Singapore
## Inspired by an article by the Straits Times called "Largest share of divorces and annulments in Sâ€™pore is among those wed for between 5 and 10 years"

Data taken from SingStat at https://www.singstat.gov.sg/publications/population/marriages-and-divorces


### Key Findings

1.  Proportion Of Brides Aged Below 21 Years is about about 3x of Proportion Of Grooms Aged Below 21 Years
2.  Men generally get married older than Women and the distribution of age in which Men are married is more dispersed than Women.
3.  Extremely pronounced and sharp increase in couples get married with their age gap being <= 2 years.
4.  Marriages are usually not held in April and August, possibly due to the cultural/religious beliefs of the majority Chinese population in Singapore.
4b. Fall in monthly Chinese-Chinese marriages (from the monthly average) is about proportionate to the proportion of Buddhist+Taoist Chinese in Singapore.
